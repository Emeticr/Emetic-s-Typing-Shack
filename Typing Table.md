#Mr. Dirty - By Emetic (AI Enhanced)

Chapter 1 - Dirty:
Mr. Dirty was very, very dirty until he learned about a shower. Then he realized he was too lazy to take a shower and he hated tap water touching him so he just went outside on a raiy day, dried off, and got to work on the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser so he never had to touch grass again.

Chapter 2 - No Experience: 
  Mr. Dirty realized he had no experience with designing because when he was 17 and went to his cousin's house, he went on their computer, and the model was so bad that it made the computer's SSD fail. He got to work underpaying the designers until he got a model so good that it made the computer's SSD get 1 terabyte more storage.

Chapter 4 - Magic Eraser: 
  The final result was the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, and it was so bad that they hired paid actors to lie about their product. He scrubbed it on himself and remained dirty. Mr. Dirty always wanted to be clean, so he changed his name to Mr. Clean.
